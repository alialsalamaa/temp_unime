***UniME Overview.** Stage 1 pretrains a single ViT Uni-Encoder with masked self-supervision and a lightweight auxiliary decoder (discarded after pretraining). Stage 2 introduces parallel modality-specific encoders and performs multi-scale feature fusion for segmentation.*

This repository now ships multiple released model scales in addition to the original paper configuration. `UniME` with `UniEncoder` corresponds to the original setting, while `UniMEBase`, `UniMESmall`, `UniMETiny`, and `UniMENano` are released scale variants with tuned training scripts and hyperparameters.

## Model Variants

| Segmentation model | Pretrain encoder | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UniME` | `UniEncoder` | Original configuration and reproduction path |
| `UniMEBase` | `UniEncoderBase` | Released Base variant with tuned training scripts |
| `UniMESmall` | `UniEncoderSmall` | Released Small variant with tuned training scripts |
| `UniMETiny` | `UniEncoderTiny` | Released Tiny variant with tuned training scripts |
| `UniMENano` | `UniEncoderNano` | Released Nano variant with tuned training scripts |

## Pre-requisites

This local checkout includes paper-aligned training settings and regression
checks. See [PAPER_REPRODUCTION.md](PAPER_REPRODUCTION.md) for the changes,
remaining implementation choices, and the command that preserves the study's
existing patient split. Use `UniME` / `UniEncoder` for the original architecture.

The 23 September 2026 six-item restoration is documented there. For current
Nebius preparation use the existing `.venv-unime` (PyTorch2.8.0+cu126) and
[BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md](BENCHMARK_PROTOCOL.md). The cluster environment setup
below describes the old server, not current Nebius readiness. No GPU job is
submitted by the restoration.

#### 1. Set Up the Python Environment

  ```bash
conda env create -f environment-cluster.yml
conda activate unime
  ```

The cluster environment uses PyTorch 2.6.0 and torchvision 0.21.0 with CUDA 12.4,
because this server's glibc 2.26 cannot run the paper's PyTorch 2.8 CUDA builds.
For a system with glibc >= 2.28, `environment-paper.yml` defines a separate
`unime-paper` environment with PyTorch 2.8.0. Both use the same paper-aligned
training code. `requirements.txt` preserves the upstream snapshot.

#### 2. Prepare Datasets

Download the **BraTS 2023** dataset and process it using the provided script:

  ```bash
python scripts/brats23_process.py \
  --raw-dir ../data/ASNR-MICCAI-BraTS2023-GLI-Challenge-TrainingData \
  --split-json ../artifacts/splits/official_imfuse_split.json \
  --write-mapping
  ```

After processing, organize the data in the following structure:

  ```text
.
└── data
    └── BRATS2023
        ├── seg/
        ├── vol/
        ├── train.txt
        ├── val.txt
        └── test.txt
  ```

where

  - `vol/` contains the processed MRI volumes.
  - `seg/` contains the corresponding segmentation labels.
  - `train.txt`, `val.txt`, and `test.txt` define the default dataset splits.

#### 3. Configuration

First, review the GPU and wandb settings in the shell scripts you plan to use. The codebase supports multi-GPU training through Hugging Face Accelerate. If you have not configured Accelerate yet, run `accelerate config` once and keep the generated settings locally. When launching with Accelerate, select devices through shell-level `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or your local Accelerate config; `--gpu_ids` remains as the direct `python ...` fallback knob. Under Accelerate, `--batch_size` is **per process**, so the effective global batch size is `batch_size * num_processes`. If you want to monitor training with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai), configure your account:

  ```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_api_key
  ```

Then update the project and entity fields in the scripts. Using wandb will introduce **additional training overhead**. If you prefer not to use it, simply set:

  ```code
--wandb_mode disabled
  ```

in the scripts to avoid logging.

## Training Scripts

The repository provides both standalone stage scripts and one-click end-to-end scripts.

| Script | What it runs | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/pipeline/` | End-to-end launchers that run pretraining first and then fine-tuning for a matched model scale | Use when you want a one-command workflow |
| `scripts/pipeline/train_base.sh` | Pretrains `UniEncoderBase`, then fine-tunes `UniMEBase` | Released `Base` variant |
| `scripts/pipeline/train_small.sh` | Pretrains `UniEncoderSmall`, then fine-tunes `UniMESmall` | Released `Small` variant |
| `scripts/pipeline/train_tiny.sh` | Pretrains `UniEncoderTiny`, then fine-tunes `UniMETiny` | Released `Tiny` variant |
| `scripts/pipeline/train_nano.sh` | Pretrains `UniEncoderNano`, then fine-tunes `UniMENano` | Released `Nano` variant |
| `scripts/pipeline/train_original.sh` | Pretrains `UniEncoder`, then fine-tunes `UniME` | Reproduces the original model setting |
| `scripts/pretrain.sh` | Runs only stage-1 pretraining for `UniEncoder` | Standalone pretraining |
| `scripts/finetune.sh` | Runs only stage-2 fine-tuning for `UniME` | Standalone fine-tuning from an existing pretrained checkpoint |

## Script Usage

#### 1. Pre-training

Run the pretraining stage with:

  ```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/pretrain.sh
bash ./scripts/pretrain.sh
  ```

`scripts/pretrain.sh` executes pretraining independently for `UniEncoder`.
Select a GPU with `UNIME_GPU_IDS`; W&B defaults to disabled. For distributed
training, adapt the launcher to Accelerate and preserve global batch size 4.

#### 2. Fine-tuning

`scripts/finetune.sh` automatically uses the matched pretraining seed and
`ema_best_checkpoint.pth` under `log_pretrain_paper/`. To use another checkpoint,
set `UNIME_PRETRAIN_CHECKPOINT`. The script checks that the weights exist and
does not run pretraining itself. Run:

  ```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/finetune.sh
bash ./scripts/finetune.sh
  ```

#### 3. One-Click End-to-End Runs
If you want a matched pretraining + fine-tuning workflow in one command, use the scripts in `scripts/pipeline/`. These scripts first run pretraining for the corresponding `UniEncoder*`, then launch fine-tuning for the matching `UniME*`.

To reproduce the original `UniEncoder` + `UniME` configuration described in the paper, run:

```bash
bash ./scripts/pipeline/train_original.sh
```

To run the released scale variants with tuned training scripts and hyperparameters, run:

```bash
bash ./scripts/pipeline/train_base.sh
bash ./scripts/pipeline/train_small.sh
bash ./scripts/pipeline/train_tiny.sh
bash ./scripts/pipeline/train_nano.sh
```


#### 4. Gradient Checkpointing

To better balance training speed and GPU memory usage across different hardware setups, the codebase supports gradient checkpointing in the encoder, regularizer, and decoder modules. These switches are configured in `models/__init__.py` through `MODEL_CHECKPOINT_CONFIGS`.
